#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.6.10


Feed generation and a more swipey river.


- Bug Fixes
    - Feed list creation was broken on the subscribe page
    - Bug with OTP qr code generating a bad url for scanning
    - Fixed a bug with navigation keys in concord outliner engine (submitted pull request)
    - Picture enclosures now go to twitter as media attachments
    - Remove old generated qr codes from /tmp
    - Fix offset bug on mobile river stylesheet
    - Sometimes "cartulizing..." message wouldn't show up
    - Fix for some utf-8 bugs in the aggregator
    - Tweet length miscalculated sometimes when media present
    - Jquery upload bug
    - Fixed a url shortener bug when certain "profane" words are present

- New Feature: RSS Feed Generator in the Editor
    - You can now build RSS feeds with the editor.  When you click the "New" button, you will have the option to create a standard
      outline or an RSS feed.  The available "type" options will be different depending on which one you choose.  This uses the
      FreePod engine to generate the feeds, and that project will be updated along-side FreedomController.

- Improvements:
    - There are new gestures in the mobile river:
        - Swipe left on an article will cart the article.
        - Swipe right will unsticky an river item.
        - Swipe left on an already cart'd article and you can change the title of the article in your archive.
        - Long-press a river item title will cart the article.
        - Long-press any link within the body of a cart'd article will cart the page at that link and open it in a new browser tab. Be
          aware that on IOS (and maybe Android), you have to disable the popup blocker in the browser settings for this to work.  On
          IOS 9, if you disable the popup blocker it will start asking you each time: "Do you want to allow this popup".  And you just
          say yes or no.
    - The editor now timestamps every new node.  You can change the timestamp of any node by placing the bar cursor on it and
      hitting the little clock menu at the top of the editor.
    - Sticky river items now sort oldest to newest.
    - The editor now has a "code" node type.
    - CORS is automatically set for buckets that share files to other web services like myword.io
    - Switched some functions to the AWS sdk.
