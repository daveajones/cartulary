#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.5.2


This is primarily a security release.  The most important things are:

- Cleaned up some non-validating of the $max variable in sql statements coming from cgi
  scripts.  It's clumsy to use prepared statement placeholders for this type of thing, but
  the input still MUST be checked for validity.  So now it is.  As far as I can tell with
  my own eyes there is no more non-validated sql.  Everything is either a prepared statement
  or gets validated before inclusion.

- Two-factor authentication is now available in the prefs page.  For now, it only works with
  the Google authenticator mobile app.  For it to work properly, your server MUST be in sync
  with the rest of the world time-wise.  If you're on Ubuntu, just install the ntpd daemon
  (apt-get install ntpd) and you're gold.  If, for some reason, you have a user that forgets
  his/her time code, you can reset them in the user admin page.  Just do a normal password
  reset on them and two-factor will be disabled as part of that process.  Once they get
  in they can set it all back up.

  So, basically after you run this upgrade, make sure you do:
  sudo apt-get install ntp
  sudo apt-get install php5-gd

- Clearing session data on logout.  We store copies of the sticky and non-sticky rivers in
  sessionStorage.  These values are now cleared upon logout.

- Cleaned up the code in the php API files and split a lot of stuff out into other files.

- There is also a sample template if you want to run a pure ssl server - meaning users
  who hit port 80 get bounced to 443.  The file is in "templates/apache-secure.conf" if you
  want to use it.  You'll have to take care of all the key/cert generation yourself through
  the normal means.  These days SSL is a very good idea.  Especially when transmitting things
  like two-factor authentication seed values and qr codes.  You really want that going
  over an encrypted channel.
